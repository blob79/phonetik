phonetik
========

Phonetik is a fork of the [Phonet class from phonet4java](http://code.google.com/p/phonet4java/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/com/googlecode/phonet4java/Phonet.java).  Both are implementations of the [C phonet library](http://www.heise.de/ct/ftp/99/25/252/) in Java.

The sole purpose of this fork is to allow improvements, i.e. everything done here should end up in phonet4java later. The main difference between phonet4java and phonetik is that it runs a suite of tests against the C implementation. Changes are mostly driven by discrepancies between the original implementation and the port.
